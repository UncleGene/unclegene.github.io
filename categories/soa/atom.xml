    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years the new hype took over the software industry: &ldquo;Microservices&rdquo;. It started slowly, with articles and presentations popping here and there, and now it is everywhere. The most interesting part is that the industry still cannot agree on what &ldquo;Microservices&rdquo; really are (or even, how to write them - Microservices, Micro-services or Micro Services)</p>

<p>In March of 2014 James Lewis and Martin Fowler published an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">article</a> in an attempt to summarize the meaning of this term (and contributing to the hype wide spread).</p>

<h3>Interlude: Conspiracy Theory</h3>

<blockquote><p><p>The term &ldquo;microservice&rdquo; was discussed at a workshop of software architects near Venice in May, 2011 to describe what the participants saw as a common architectural style that many of them had been recently exploring. In May 2012, the same group decided on &ldquo;microservices&rdquo; as the most appropriate name.</p> &mdash; James Lewis &amp; Martin Fowler, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">March 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Yep, anonymous workshop of anonymous architects anonymously decided on &ldquo;microservices&rdquo; as the most appropriate name&hellip; BTW, were they all from the same anonymous company?</p>

<hr />

<p>Originally (and, AFAIK, even in the first revision of the Lewis &amp; Fowler article) Microservices had a strong emphasis on Micro, and even referred to a 10-100 LOC size guideline. After getting pretty strong pushback on any size limitations from many practitioners, all the size references were gone (finally a reality check?), and &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; part started to be more and more frequently referred as being &ldquo;just a name&rdquo;</p>

<p>With &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; semantics dropped out of the picture, it became obvious (to many people, though there is no real consensus here neither) that Microservices are just SOA striving for a new identity, because an old one had too bad reputation.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en"><p>I guess it is easier to use a new name (Microservices) rather than say that this is what SOA actually meant - re <a href="http://t.co/gvhxDfDWLG">http://t.co/gvhxDfDWLG</a></p>&mdash; Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz (@arnonrgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/arnonrgo/status/445188642727034880">March 16, 2014</a></blockquote>




<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler">@martinfowler</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/boicy">@boicy</a> but these are the very principles of SOA before vendors does pushed the hub in the middle, i.e. ESB</p>&mdash; Clemens Vasters (@clemensv) <a href="https://twitter.com/clemensv/status/445216182757756929">March 16, 2014</a></blockquote>




<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/UncleGene">@UncleGene</a> Micro-Services are just SOA done properly &#8211; simple functionality, well-defined interfaces, minimal dependencies</p>&mdash; Randy Shoup (@randyshoup) <a href="https://twitter.com/randyshoup/status/530820576810926080">November 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><p><a href="http://service-architecture.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/microservices-is-soa-for-those-who-know.html">Microservices is SOA, for those who know what SOA is.</a></p> &mdash; Steve Jones March 18, 2014</p></blockquote>

<p>So, to understand what &ldquo;Microservices&rdquo; really are, we should first understand what is SOA (and what is SOA done properly). Rose may smell sweet by any name, but if you step into [something] - you can name it a rose (or micro[something]), but smell will not change until you clean up your shoes.</p>

<p>You can see my &ldquo;tongue-in-cheek&rdquo; definition <a href="http://203.softover.com/2014/11/21/wth-is-soa/">here</a>, please stay tuned for the real one coming soon.</p>
