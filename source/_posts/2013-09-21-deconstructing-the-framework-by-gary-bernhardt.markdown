Rails gives us M, V, C, routes, and helpers. Some people add observers and concerns, among others. We've standardized on presenters. Service objects are gaining popularity. Uncle Bob wants you to add interactors, request models, response models, and entities.

That's a lot of stuff! Let's step back: ideally, how do all of these things fit together? Does it make sense to have so many different components? How do different web frameworks project these onto actual components? Most importantly: how does this explain the tangled mess in Rails controllers and how we might fix it?
